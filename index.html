    Hi I'm Rigor Mortis (though knowing me, I might change my moniker in the next minute), an escaped Ghost Mortis clone (one of those scraps rejected design ones) who wants to make a new off game and also tries to make a comic for this website, I made.<br>
    <br>
    Special thanks to:<br>
    <strong>a good username</strong> for telling me this wonderful font. (P.S. Which, by the way, I couldn't use because for some reason the font color changes depending on the size of the site. I don't know what is causing it, but I am too damn impatient to figure it out.)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>snoe</strong> for helping me with the syntax, whom without I might have been stuck for months.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Experimentieren</strong> and <strong>Jouk</strong>  for checking my comics for grammar errors.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cỏ May Bay</strong> for helping me also with JavaScript and making The Clock GIF.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, I made up a few Questions and Answers that I made up for myself because I am alone and nobody would ask these questions right now anyway. However, if you want to ask me some questions, go to <br>
    <a href="E-mailToMe.html">Contact me!</a> and send me an e-mail.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Who are you?<br>
    A:I am an 18 (as of written in 2022) year old boy who likes off and RPG games and not so RPG games as well. If I am not lazy I might try to make a game and some mods for other games too.(see World of Horror Batter Character I made.) But before you give any faith in me, I must say I am quite unreliable, but right now I try to focus on my comic, which will be a few scenes from my game, and if things go well, I might make a demo too.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Why are you wasting your time making this website and making comics when you could be making the game?<br>
    A:Well, here is the sad truth. I can't really draw well; I am actually pretty not good at it. These Comics I try to make will not be for how good they will look, but more for the story I try to make. I hope that somebody who is good with art (with pixel art that is) could help me out with making the game characters into sprites that I can use while I try to make the code.<br>
    <br>
    Q:What will be your game be about?<br>
    A:Ain't going to tell you that. I want you to experience that yourself. Don't let me tell you how to feel.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Then, what is your game gameplay going to look like? Will you use the original battle system or something new?<br>
    A:I thought instead of the RPG maker battle system I try to replicate Toby Fox's Deltarune battle system, and for bosses I thought maybe I could try to replicate Just Shapes & Beats, but that one I am less sure of.
    I already own GameMaker Studio 2, which made Deltarune, so that one is done already.<br>
    <br>
    Q:How much do you want to stick to the original game Off style wise?<br>
    A:I try to be as conservative of how Ghost Mortis did the original game as possible (other than the battle system and the program that he used). I try to draw the enemies on paper and use a scanner, and then redraw them in PaintTool SAI.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Is the Batter still going to be the one we play?<br>
    A:Yes.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Are you going to charge me for your shitty game?<br>
    A:Woo now easy boy, no the game will be free, and if people want to support me despite that, they can do that trough Patreon, but that's going to be in the far future.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Are you sure you are capable of doing this?<br>
    A:I honestly don't know what I feel about this, but I am not planning to stop.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Do you own a boat?<br>
    A:No...? I live in a landlocked country. I mean, I could buy a small boat on the rivers here as many people do, but I don't own any boat, why does that even matter?<br>
    <br>
    Q:Are you going to post any updates here?<br>
    A:Yes, I thought uploading some mods I might make for other games. I thought of making the batter into Brutal Orchestra and maybe into Friday Night Funking, though unsure about that one. I will keep you updated if I do it. And about the World of Horror One, I will definitely update it as soon as the Update from the main game is up.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Is it legal that you make a continuation of a game? Did you even ask Mortis for permission?<br>
    A:I suppose it is? The game will be free no matter what, and I plan to write an e-mail to Mortis when I have a demo to show (Don't want to go there empty-handed). Just imagine me continuing a folklore story, just a messenger, nothing more.<br>
    <br>
    Q:How different will the story be from the original game?<br>
    A:Very. Very much.<br>
    <br>
    Q:How do you eat your cereal?<br>
    A:I always put the cereal in to the bowl first, only after I pour the milk into the bowl. Oh, and the milk has to be cold, or I shall not sing any ode to joy.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Will this game contain any stuff from fangames?<br>
    A:I am going to be honest, I never played a fangame so nay.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Will there be old characters showing up in the game?<br>
    A:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMUEFZXkmDA&t=1s&ab_channel=Evident%27sGamingChannel" id=ItsASecret>Its A Secret!</a><br>
    <br>
    Q:What the feck was that link?<br>
    A:Yummi nikki? The one that used Gaster before it was "cool"? The Indie RPG horror games forfather? No? Nothing? Doesn't ring any bells? Well it's just a stupid video then.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Do you think you have the creativity of Ghost Mortis to make the game?<br>
    A:No. I am not him. I am me. I do what I am good at. I don't have the way he thinks, and for some, I am not the best suited for this, but what I excel in I try to use it here. I do try to make something and if I fail then you can tell me I was an idiot for trying.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Can you make the same atmosphere feeling like in off?<br>
    A:Think of this as a Jamais vu I think Off should be about what the creator wants it to be, let this massage be an inspiration for all those who want to make a new off game. Make it big and make at as much as yours as you can. Thats what makes of off.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Who are you to take legitimacy and uphold the title of Off 2 and continue the legacy of Off?<br>
    <s>A:I don't know. Nobody seem to want to continue it (as of 2022/06/30), thought I could try, I mean there isn't many off 2 websites is there? Claiming the right to continue the game.</s><br>
    A:What an absolute moronic answer, what are you an idiot? Of course after 20 years we get a re-relase of the game with new feature and with extra story bits so this answer is untrue halfly. Fortunatly countinuation isn't on the horizon. Therefore I will try to countine as if nothing happend. I am very happy with the re-relase I bet its going to be awesome.<br>
    <br>
    I think this is enough for now, again if you have any question just send me an e-mail trough "Contact Me!"<br>
    Have a nice day! And thank you so much for reading!
