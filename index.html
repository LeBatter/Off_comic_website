    Hi i'am Rigor Mortis (though knowing me i might change my moniker in the next minute) an escaped Ghost Mortis clone (one of those scraps rejected desing ones) whom wants to make a new off game and also tries to make a comics for this website i made.<br>
    <br>
    Speacial thanks to:<br>
    <strong>a good username</strong> for telling me this wonderful font.(P.S. Which by the way i coudnt use becouse for some reason the font colour changes depending on the size of the site i don't know what is cousing it but i am too damn unpaitent to figure it out.<br>
    <strong>snoe</strong> for helping me with the syntax whom without i might would have been stuck for months<br>
    <br>
    Anyway i made up a few Question and Answers that i made up for myself because i am lonly and nobody would ask these question right now anyway. However if you want to ask me some questions go to <br>
    "Contact me!" and send me an e-mail.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Who are you?<br>
    A:I am an 18 (as of written in 2022) year old boy who likes off and rpg games and not so rpg games as well. If i am not lazy i might try to make a game and some mods for other games too.(see World of Horror Batter Character i made) But before you give any faith in me i must say i am quite unrelible but right now i try to focus on my comic which will be the a few scenes from my game and if thing go good i might make a demo to.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Why are you wasting your time making this website and making comics when you could be making the game?<br>
    A:Well here is the sad truth. I can't really draw well i am actually pretty not good at it. These Comics i try to make will not be for how good they will look but more for the story i try to make. i hope that sombody who is good with art (with pixel art that is) could help me out with making the game characters into sprites that i can use while i try to make the code.<br>
    <br>
    Q:What will be your game be about?<br>
    A:Ain't going to tell you that. I want you to experience that yourself. Dont let me tell you how to feel.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Then what is your game gameplay is going to look like? Will you use the orignal battle system or something new?<br>
    A:I thought instead of the rpg maker battle system i try to replicate Toby Fox's Deltarune battle system and for bosses i thought maybe i could try to replicate Just Shapes & Beats but that one i am less sure of.
    I already own GameMaker Studio 2 which made delature so that one is done already.<br>
    <br>
    Q:How much do you want to stick to the original game off style wise?<br>
    A:I try to be as consarvative of how Ghost Mortis did the original game as possible (other then the battle system and the program that he used)I try to draw the enemies on paper and use a scanner and then redrawn them in PaintTool SAI.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Is the Batter still going to be the one we play?<br>
    A:Yes.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Are you going to charge me for your shitty game?<br>
    A:Woo now easy boy no the game will be free and if people want to support me despite that they can do that trough patreon but thats going to be in the far future.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Are you sure you are capable of doing this?<br>
    A:I honestly dont know what i feel about this but i am not planing to stop.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Do you own boat?<br>
    A:No...? I live in a landlock country i mean i could buy a small boat on the rivers here as many people do but i dont own any boat why does that even matter?<br>
    <br>
    Q:Are you going to post any upatates here?<br>
    A:Yes i thought uploding some mods i might make for other games. i thought making the batter into Brutal Orchestra and maybe into Friday Night Funking though unsure about that one I keep you uptated if i will do it. And about the World of Horror One i will definetly uptate it as soon as the Uptate from the main game is up.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Is it legal that you make a continuation of a game? Did you even ask Mortis for permission?<br>
    A:I suppose it is? The game will be free no matter what and i plan to write an e-mail to Mortis when i have demo to show (Dont want to go there empty handed). Just imagine me continuing a folklore story, just a massanger nothing more.<br>
    <br>
    Q:How different will the story be from the original game?<br>
    A:Very.Very much.<br>
    <br>
    Q:How do you eat your cereal?<br>
    A:I always put the cereal in to the bowl first only after i pour the milk into the bowl. Oh and the milk has to be cold or i shall not sing any ode to joy.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Will this game contain any stuff from fangames?<br>
    A:I am going to be honest i never played a fangame so nay.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Will there be old characters showing up in the game?<br>
    A:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMUEFZXkmDA&t=1s&ab_channel=Evident%27sGamingChannel" id=ItsASecret!>Its A Secret!</a><br>
    <br>
    Q:What the feck was that link?<br>
    A:Yummi nikki? The one that used gaster before it was "cool"? The Indie rpg horror games forfater? No? Nothing? Doesnt ring any bells? Well its just a stupid video then.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Do you think you have the creativity of Ghost Mortis to make the game?<br>
    A:No. I am not him. I am me. I do what i am good at. I dont have the way he thinks and for some, I am not the best suited for this, but what i excel in i try to use it here. I do try to make something and if i fail then you can tell me i was a idiot for trying.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Can you make the same atmosphere feeling like in off?<br>
    A:Think of this as a Jamais vu i think off should be about what the creator wants it to be let this massage be an inspiration for all those who want to make a new off game. Make it big and make at as much as yours as you can.Thats what makes of off.<br>
    <br>
    Q:Who are you to take legitimacy and withhold the title of Off 2 and countine the legacy of off?<br>
    A:I dont know. Nobody seem to want to countine it(as of 2022/06/30), thought i could try, i mean there isnt many off 2 websites there is there, claming the right to countine the game.<br>
    <br>
    I think this is enough for now again if you have any question just send me an e-mail trough "Contact Me!"<br>
    Have a nice day! And thank you so much for reading!
